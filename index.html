        <h2> About Minions</h2>
        <p>
            In view of the way they dress, you could have assumed that the minions are both male and female, but in reality, none of them are female. Since they are insane, one of their favorite pastimes is cross-dressing. (Much as they enjoy singing)
            As you can see, they have very simple vocabulary and speech patterns. Minionese is a language made out of a combination of terms from several other languages. It has a sprinkling of Korean and Russian along with French, English, Italian,
            and Spanish. Actually, a few of the terms they employ are only the names of various dishes. (However, their go-to banana remains unchanged.)

        <h2>Minions and Their Master</h2>
        <p>
            Minions are biologically wired to seek out and serve the most terrible of villains; when they have no "boss" to serve, they become depressed and listless.
